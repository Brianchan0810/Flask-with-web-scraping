Welcome to this repository!

This project is about constructing a web app for providing recommendations for purchasing air-conditioners in Broadway Lifestyle.

Users are required to input at least one criterion and 3 air-conditioners matching all criteria with the lowest price would be displayed in a table.

The project is divided into 2 parts:

1. **Web Scraping and Data storage ~ main.py**
    - All air-conditioners available on Broadway website with their corresponding information and features are collected
    - The whole dataset is then stored in a relational database

2. **Web Application ~ app.py**
